This study investigates how the telephone conversations that are carried out for Covid-19 contact tracing in Flanders 
take form and in which manners we can improve these telephone conversations. For this purpose, 
we audio record such conversations and submit these to fine-grained interactional analysis. 
The research aims to optimize contact tracing (given the negative perception and reports of Covid-19 contact tracing in the media). 
The project thus contributes to the collective interest of public health, confidence in the manner in which the government combats the pandemic, 
and the effectiveness of contact tracing.
